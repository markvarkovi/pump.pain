          At BODANCERS, we provide a space for investors to express their anger,
          disappointment, and pain openly and without judgment. Whether you are a seasoned
          trader or a newcomer to the world of crypto, we are here to lend an ear and
          offer support during these difficult times. But we are not just a sounding board
          for venting frustrations.

          <br />
          Together, we are building a community which is able to shield against rugging
          and swinging. If you have been rug-pulled and need a shoulder to lean on, or if
          you want to join the fight against rug-pullers, BODANCERS are here for you. Just
          roll a joint and join the BODANCERS!
