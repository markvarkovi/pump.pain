          At Pump.Pain, we provide a space for investors to express their anger,
          disappointment, and pain openly and without judgment. Whether you are a seasoned
          trader or a newcomer to the world of crypto, we are here to lend an ear and
          offer support during these difficult times. But we are not just a sounding board
          for venting frustrations.

          Our community serves as a gathering place for investors to share information
          about the mechanics of rugpulling, invent solutions, and track the wallet of
          rugpullers.
          <br />
          <br />
          Together, we are building a database to shine a light on these fraudulent
          practices and protect others from falling victim in the future. If you have been
          rug-pulled and need a shoulder to lean on, or if you want to join the fight
          against rug-pullers, Pump.Pain is here for you. Just fill in a report, provide
          evidence and we will display the ID of the Rugrat!
